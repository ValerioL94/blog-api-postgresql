# blog-api-postgresql
Building a full-stack blog app

The complete app will have:

- API only backend made with express-typescript and postgresql/prismaORM database;
- One frontend site where users can read posts and add comments, made with react-typescript;
- A second frontend site where registered authors can manage both posts and comments, made with react-typescript.
